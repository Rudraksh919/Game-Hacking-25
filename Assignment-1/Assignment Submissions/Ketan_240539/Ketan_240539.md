# Writeups for Assignment 1


## GDB

### [GDB Baby Step 1](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/395?category=3&page=1&search=GDB)

1. Opening the binary using `gdb ./debugger0_a`
2. Using `disas main` to diassemble main function we get that `0x86342` is being stored in EAX register.
3. Converting hex to decimal we get the required integer.


### [GDB Baby Step 2](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/396?category=3&page=1&search=GDB)

1. Opened the binary using `gdb ./debugger0_b`
2. using `b *0x401142` to set breakpoint at then end of main function
3. use `print $eax` to check value in eax register.
4. we get the flag `picoCTF{307019}`

### [GDB Baby Step 3](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/397?category=3&page=1&search=GDB)

1. using `disas main` to see the main function
2. Then setting breakpoint after the constant is loaded in the memory.
3. Examining memory byte-wise using given `x/4xb $rbp-4` command.
4. we get the flag: `picoCTF{0x6bc96222}`
![alt text](images/image-3.png)


what does this command means?\
x -> examine memory \
4 -> 4 units of memory\
x -> hexdecimal format\
b -> define unit size: byte



### [GDB Baby Step 4](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/398?category=3&page=1&search=GDB)

1. using `info functions` we get to know that `func1` is the function PS is referring to. 
2. setting breakpoint at `func1` and examining disassembly using `disas` we get
![alt text](images/image-4.png)
3. We can clearly see the constant that is  being multiplied is `0x3269` which in decimal is `12905`
4. we get out flag `picoCTF{12905}`


## Reversing Crackmes

### [Crackmes - 1 - ezman's easy keyg3nme](https://crackmes.one/crackme/5da31ebc33c5d46f00e2c661)

On opening `keyg3nme` binary, it asked for a key. Generating the pseudocode we got a `validate_key` key validation function which just check if the input is divisible by 1223.

### [Crackmes - 2 - cbm-hackers's jumpjumpjump](https://crackmes.one/crackme/5c1a939633c5d41e58e005d1)

On reversing using IDA, I found that the binary asks user for a string and checks where the sum of ASCII values of user input is == 1000. \
So I tried `d`*10 times since ascii of lowercase `d` is `100`. Didn't get the flag. \
On further checking from pseudocode, I found that the new line character (ascii 10) is included in the summation.
Therefore I needed to make sum = 990. \
using `n` 9 times, since ascii of n is 110 solve this.\

### [Crackmes - 4 - Silva97's login-cipher](https://crackmes.one/crackme/5db0ef9f33c5d46f00e2c729)

On opening the binary with IDA and getting the pseudocode, there was a function for decoding actual strings and printing it. 
The function uses this algo for decryption
```cpp
_BYTE *__fastcall decrypter(_BYTE *a1)
{
  int v2; // [rsp+Ch] [rbp-Ch]
  _BYTE *v3; // [rsp+10h] [rbp-8h]

  v3 = a1;
  v2 = 1969;
  while ( *v3 )
  {
    v2 = 7 * v2 % 0x10000;
    *v3++ -= v2 % 10;
  }
  return a1;
}
```

```cpp
__int64 __fastcall main(int a1, char **a2, char **a3)
{
  char v4[72]; // [rsp+0h] [rbp-50h] BYREF
  unsigned __int64 v5; // [rsp+48h] [rbp-8h]

  v5 = __readfsqword(0x28u);
  decrypt_string_and_print("Gtu.}'uj{fq!p{$", 1);
  decrypt_string_and_print(aLszl, 0);
  __isoc99_scanf("%64[^\n]", v4);
  if ( validator(v4, (__int64)"fhz4yhx|~g=5") )
    decrypt_string_and_print("Zwvup(", 1);
  else
    decrypt_string_and_print("Ftyynjy*", 1);
  return 0LL;
}
```

the `validator` function checks if the input string is equal to decrypted version of `fhz4yhx|~g=5` using same decryption algorithm. 

> This same algorithm was used to decrypt the password and initial texts.

Wrote this python script to decrypt the string.

```py
def decrypt(s):
    v = 1969
    out = ""
    for c in s:
        v = (7 * v) % 0x10000
        out += chr(ord(c)-(v % 10))
    return out
print(decrypt("fhz4yhx|~g=5"))
```
got `ccs-passwd44` as password.

### [Crackmes - 5 - math__0x0's iso_32](https://crackmes.one/crackme/5d8dfa7433c5d46f00e2c544)

On opening using IDA, there were only 2 functions being called from main()
```cpp
int __cdecl main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp)
{
  f();
  _f_func();
  return 0;
}
```
the `f()` function asks user for password using scanf and `_f_func()` outputs "Ooop!! Try again".
There was another function `_s_func()` found using `objdump -D` which outputs "Great!!". So it was obvious we have to call that function somehow abusing buffer overflow.

First to get the payload, I opened binary in gdb using `gdb ./crackme`
the running the binary using `run` and I tried entering this long pattern
`AABBCCDDEEFFGGHHIIJJKKLLMMNNOOPPQQRRSSTTUUVVWWXXYYZZ` which received segfault at `0x58585757`
![alt text](images/image-1.png)

This means there are 44 characters before this (57 is ascii for W)
So now to add the address of `_s_func` to EIP pointer, we will need to get its address using 
```bash
objdump -D ./crackme | grep __s_func
```
we got `08049182` as address. Converting this to little endian format, we get `82910408` now we can make payload like 
```bash
python3 -c "import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b'A'*44 + b'\x82\x91\x04\x08')" > /tmp/payload
```
I previously tried using print function in python but that was writing some extra bytes to payload due to some unicode encoding issues for bytes and not making correct payload\
![alt text](images/image-5.png)
and use like this 
```bash
cat /tmp/payload | ./crackme
```


Thankyou.
