## Challenge: 1 {GDB baby step 1}

This challenge contains basic ctf challenge which is:
``` ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable``` 
1. Run it in gdb by ```gdb debugger0_a ```.

2. Check functions by 
``` info functions ``` ; this will open list of functions.

3. Disassemble main function and you will see your required eax register value  ``` 0x86342 ```. When you convert it to decimal, we get ```549698```.

4. Hence, flag is ``` picoCTF{549698} ```.


## Challenge: 2 {GDB baby step 2}

This challenge contains ``` ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable``` 
1. Run it in gdb by ```gdb debugger0_b ```.

2. Check functions by ``` info functions ``` ; this will open list of functions.

3. Disassemble main function. Since, we need to find what is value of ```eax``` register at end of main function, so put a break there and run the elf.

4. check value of ```eax``` register by ``` print $eax ```. You will get ``` 307019```.
5. Hence, flag is ``` picoCTF{307019} ```.

## Challenge: 3 {GDB baby step 3}

This challenge also contains ``` ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable``` 
1. Run it in gdb by ```gdb debugger0_c```.

2. Check functions by ``` info functions ``` ; this will open list of functions.

3. Disassemble main function. 
4. Upon inspection of ```main```, we note that ```mov``` moves the constant value into a memory location (rbp-4). So, we put a break point just after that memory address load in rbp.

4. Check address by given command ``` x/4xb $rbp-4 ```. It gives all bytes stored in memeory at that address ```0x6b 0xc9 0x62 0x22```
5. Hence, flag is ``` picoCTF{0x6bc96222}```.

## Challenge: 4 {GDB baby step 4}

This challenge also contains ``` ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable``` 
1. Run it in gdb by ```gdb debugger0_d```.

2. Check functions by ``` info functions ``` ; this will open list of functions.

3. Disassemble main function. Upon inspection of ```main```and challenge description, ```func1``` multiplies ```eax``` bya constant. So, we put a break point just before and after that function and check value of ``eax ``` is both places.

4. Those values are `654` and `8439870`. On division we get our required constant `12905`.
5. Hence, flag is ``` picoCTF{12905} ```.

## Challenge: 5 {ezman's easy keyg3nme}
(unzip the zip file by password ```crackmes.one```)

This challenge also contains ``` ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable```, which ask for key to solve it.
1. Run it in ghidra. Open main function.

2. ```main``` function pass user input to ```validate key```, which check if it dived by ```0x4c7```, which is in hex. on converting it ti decimal, number is ```1223```.

3. So, basically any input that is multiple of 1223, is key.

4. We got: 
``` 
chirag@hp:~/Downloads$ ./keyg3nme 
Enter your key:  1223
Good job mate, now go keygen me.
```


## Challenge: 6 {cbm-hackers's jumpjumpjump}
(unzip the zip file by password ```crackmes.one```)

This challenge also contains ``` ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable```, which ask for a magic string to solve it.
1. Run it in ghidra. Open main function.

2. ```main``` function checks user input and give flag if:
    - Length of input is leass than `0xc` which is 12.
    - Summ of ascci values of each character in string is 1000.

3. So, basically 10 times d (ascci value=100) should be key but it is not.On some more research I get that we press `enter` key that have ascii value of 10. So, correct key is 9 times `d` and one `Z` that total adds to `900+90+10 = 1000`. So, correct magic string is 
```dddddddddZ```.

5. We got flag : `flag{!#$*/5<DMW>}`.
